"Days spent in New Zealand","count","person-period","This is a rolled up version of the intermediate.spells_in_nz table, which aims to have spells in New Zealand for two arrival types (birth and border crossing) and three ""departure"" types (death, border crossing, and ""still in the country"" at time of latest movements data). There are problems in the movements data eg with people who appear to have departed twice in a row without arriving in between. These problems have been dealt with in the simplest way; an arrival is treated as ""in the country"" until the next departure, so the second departure is effectively ignored. This means an underestimate of days in the country in a small number of cases. Births and deaths have also been de-duplicated, and the problem of a very small number of spine individuals with multiple births or deaths referred to the IDI team.","How many days did this person spend in New Zealand each time period?","IDI_Clean.dia_clean.births, IDI_Clean.dia_clean.deaths, IDI_Clean.dol_clean.movements"

"Number of mental health and addictions interactions with services","count","person-period","Counts each known interaction with a service with evidence that it was related to mental health and addictions, based on a particular list of pharamceuticals, lab tests, hospitals, MSD (reason for incapacity), and PRIMHD. Note that we are counting very different things here, so the number of interactions should be treated only as indicative. The definition used for each of the five is that published by the Social Investment Agency in mid 2017. The pharmaceutical list used includes those marked by SIA as ""potential inclusion"". See https://github.com/nz-social-investment-agency/mha_data_definition for the original definition. There will be a better way of converting the simple recording of the five types of events into estimates of type or degree of mental health and addictions challenge, suggestions welcomed.","What is the mental health status of this person each time period?","IDI_Sandpit.intermediate.mha_events, IDI_Clean.moh_clean.primhd, IDI_Clean.moh_clean.pub_fund_hosp_discharges_event, IDI_Clean.moh_clean.pub_fund_hosp_discharges,

"Number of criminal offences","count","person-period","Counts one offence per criminal incident (""occurence"") for which there were court or non-court proceedings, per person, per march ye. This differs from crime_victims, as it uses pre-count data ""occurrences"" instead of ""offences"". ""Occurrences"" are single incidents and can contain multiple ""offences"". The reasoning behind using occurences rather than offences is that the post-count for offenders only counts one offence per day (even if there were multiple offences or occurences). We also would not want to count all pre-count offences, as there can be multiple offences associated with one occurence. Counting occurences seems like a more precise way of counting. In this case, each criminal incident is considered one offence. Note: uses date offender was proceeded against by Police, not neccessarily the date the incident occurred.","How many crimes did this person commit in a time period?","IDI_Clean.pol_clean.pre_count_offenders"

"Highest NQF level qualification","category","person-period","Counts highest NQF qualification (moe_sql_nqf_level_code) recorded in secondary school, per person, per march ye. It currently does not take into account any qualifications obtained in previous years, eg. someone could have achieved Level 3 in one year, and Level 2 the next year. Nor does it populate any post secondary school years, ie. someone who is no longer in school will not have any current records.
