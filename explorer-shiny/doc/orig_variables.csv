		The reasoning behind using occurences rather than offences is that the post-count for offenders only counts one offence per day (even if there were multiple offences or occurences). 
		We also would not want to count all pre-count offences, as there can be multiple offences associated with one occurence.
		Counting occurences seems like a more precise way of counting. In this case, each criminal incident is considered one offence.
